 Just completed an exciting Data Mining project: "Sequential Pattern Mining on Retail Data"!

I implemented advanced pattern mining algorithms to discover customer purchase sequences in grocery retail data. Here's what I accomplished:

 **What I Did:**
- Analyzed 38,765 transactions from 3,898 customers
- Implemented PrefixSpan algorithm for efficient pattern mining
- Discovered 215+ meaningful sequential purchase patterns
- Generated actionable business insights for retail optimization

 **Key Discoveries:**
- Identified that 6.36% of customers repeatedly purchase milk in sequence
- Found strong patterns between milk → vegetables → bread products
- Created comprehensive visualizations to showcase shopping behaviors

 **Business Impact:**
This analysis helps retailers with:
- Personalized product recommendations
- Optimized store layouts
- Targeted marketing campaigns
- Improved inventory management

 **Tech Stack:** Python, pandas, prefixspan, matplotlib, seaborn

This project demonstrates the power of data mining in uncovering valuable business intelligence from customer transaction data!
